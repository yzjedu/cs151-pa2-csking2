I was supposed to learn how to use multiple while loops and if else statements to create a game.
First I had to design a program with an algorithm to do so, and made a flowchart to make
sure I knew exactly how to write the program. My results did match what I expected to get and I used
various different error cases to make sure the code accounted for user error.
The biggest challenge that I encountered was making sure after each error case the code would not reset to the beginning,
but right back to where the error was made. I first designed the algorithm, wrote the code, and then tested it.
I think I did learn what I was supposed to, I am a lot more comfortable with while loops now.
It was nice working bymyself, I prefer it.
